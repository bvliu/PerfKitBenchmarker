# Internal Blueprint & Roadmap

## Development Guide

First start with the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/PerfKitBenchmarker/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file. It has the basics on how to work with PerfKitBenchmarker, and how to submit your pull requests.

We have added a lot of comments into the code to make it easy to:

*   Add new benchmarks (e.g.: `--benchmarks=<new benchmark>`)
*   Add new package/os type support (e.g.: `--os_type=<new os type>`)
*   Add new providers (e.g.: `--cloud=<new provider>`)
*   etc.

Even with lots of comments we make to support more detailed documention. You will find the documentation we have on the [wiki](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/PerfKitBenchmarker/wiki). Missing documentation you want? Start a page and/or open an [issue](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/PerfKitBenchmarker/issues) to get it added.

## Roadmap: Planned Improvements

Many... please add new requests via GitHub issues.
